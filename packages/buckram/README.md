## Releasing

Buckram uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), enforced with [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/). This facilitates releasing new versions of the package via [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please). Release notes will be automatically added to a PR based on commits to `dev`.

To cut a release, merge the current [release pull request](https://github.com/google-github-actions/release-please-action#whats-a-release-pr). This will tag a new GitHub release and update [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

Then, run `npm publish` from the root of the package and enter your one-time password when prompted. For more information on publishing to npm, see the [npm publish documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/publish).
